# AudioutedCore

## Purpose

This Swift package is the whole app: a UI-agnostic core library
(`AudioutedCore`) plus AppKit UI targets that link against it, and the
shipping menu-bar executable. Core must never import AppKit; UI must depend
on the model, never the reverse. `OutputBackend` is the only seam between them.

## Rules

- **`Device.isSelected` means "currently in the backend's output set"
  (streaming now) — NOT membership in the UI's Selected Devices set**
  (`GroupController.selectedDeviceIDs`). The output set is exactly the Selected
  Devices' AirPlay members (or an active group's members); the local Mac is
  filtered out, so a passthrough-only selection reaches the backend as an EMPTY
  set. Row/menu state must come from `GroupController.isSpeakerSelected(_:)`,
  never `device.isSelected`. Redirect targets stay excluded from
  `selectedDeviceIDs`/`mainOutMemberIDs` so a redirect can't move the Main Out
  master or pollute group identity — group matching keys off `mainOutMemberIDs`,
  never the live output set. The volume-key mirror (`mirrorMemberIDs`) follows
  the same rule: it drives Main Out only, never a per-app redirect target — a
  redirect no longer opens its session through the whole-system output set (see
  below), so there's nothing left for the volume keys to unstick there, and each
  redirected app already has its own independent volume control.
- **A redirected app streams to its target device via the per-app capture path,
  NOT the whole-system output set (T7).** `GroupController.applyRouting` no
  longer unions app-route targets into `backend.setOutputSet` — that union was
  the original bug (redirecting ONE app pushed the WHOLE system mix to the
  device and muted the Mac). App-route changes now flow through
  `AppRoutingController.onRoutesDidChange` → `AppDelegate.pushAppRoutesToBackend`
  → `NativeBackend.updateAppRoutes(_:excludedBundleIDs:)` (the
  `AppRouteConfiguring` seam), which starts per-app capture and binds a dedicated
  engine stream per routed device. The whole-system capture gate still keys off
  `expectedSelected` (what `setOutputSet` was last handed), which no longer
  includes redirect targets, so passthrough no longer opens it.
- **`AppRouteDestination` is three cases, not two: `.noRedirect` (new default,
  unset) / `.currentDevice` (explicit "play here" pick) / `.device(id:)`.**
  `.noRedirect` and `.currentDevice` are capture/engine-equivalent — both mean
  "plays locally, stays in the whole-system mix" — they differ only in popover
  UI state (unset vs. a deliberate choice). Don't pattern-match negatively on
  `.currentDevice` to mean "is redirected"; use `AppRouteDestination.isDeviceRoute`
  (true only for `.device`), the single source of truth for "actually routed
  away."
- **Every real (re)connect must reseed the engine volume from the Mac's current
  system level** (0% when unreadable): the engine's volume field is
  zero-initialized and 0 maps to ≈ −30 dB (silent), so a connect that pushes no
  volume streams INAUDIBLY until the first slider touch — the −30 dB trap. The one
  exception is `applyStartBuffer`'s internal teardown/re-add (a buffer-size change,
  *not* a reconnect), which preserves the in-session level instead. That is why the
  seed is gated on `bufferReAdding`, not fired unconditionally in the shared add
  path — remove the gate and a plain buffer change resets the user's level to the
  system volume. The seed (`connectVolumeSeed`) is reachable from TWO independent
  add-success sites — `convergeDevice`'s post-`addOutput` write (ordinary
  user-initiated connects) and `applyEngineState`'s `.connected`/`.streaming`
  branch (out-of-band auto-recovery reconnects that never go through
  `convergeDevice`) — and the vendored dispatcher always mirrors an armed
  `addOutput` completion onto the engine's state stream too, so an ORDINARY
  connect reaches both sites, racing which one gets to `stateQueue` first. The
  seed fires ONLY on the `added` false→true edge each site observes: whichever
  flips `added` first (both under `stateQueue`) seeds, the other sees `added`
  already true and skips — one push per connect, with NO separate seeded-set to
  clear. (An earlier `volumeSeeded: Set` hand-cleared at every teardown regressed
  live — a second disconnect→reconnect kept the first reconnect's stale level when
  a clear was missed/reordered; `added` is the connection ground truth already
  removed at every teardown, so keying on it makes that drift impossible and every
  genuine reconnect reseeds.) `pushVolume` additionally serializes per output id
  (`volumeInFlight`/`volumePending`, latest-wins) so no caller can ever have two
  `engine.setVolume` calls in flight for the same output concurrently — the
  vendored C dispatcher's "one pending callback per device" `outputs_callback_add`
  contract turns a second concurrent call into a clobbered/leaked waiter for the
  first, which is what caused a live regression (leaked `startOp` continuations,
  eventual disconnect) before this guard existed.
- The live routing set is not auto-resumed at launch (`RoutingStore` is
  write-only at launch) — a previously-selected device never auto-streams.
  Saved groups still persist and re-apply.
- `NativeBackend` has no `ConnectionDiagnosing` seam — `.failed` cause is
  always `.unknown`. `MockBackend` mutation stays no-op-silent and confined
  to its private serial queue.
- Known stability findings in this package carry `STABILITY(id)` inline
  markers — details and fix sketches in
  [../dev/notes/stability-audit-2026-07-18.md](../dev/notes/stability-audit-2026-07-18.md).

## Map

| Type | Role |
|---|---|
| `Device` | Value-type snapshot of one output; backend is the only writer. |
| `ConnectionState` / `ConnectionFailure` | Per-device connection lifecycle + failure cause. |
| `ConnectionDiagnosing` | "Why didn't it connect" seam; `OwnToneBackend`-only. |
| `GroupController` | Routing brain: Selected Devices, Main Out, groups. |
| `AppRoutingController` | Per-app routing state/destinations; `onRoutesDidChange` is the table-changed signal T7 wires to the backend. |
| `AppRouteConfiguring` | Optional backend capability (T6/T7): `updateAppRoutes` streams a routed app to its device. `NativeBackend` only. |
| `AppRouteStore` / `RoutingStore` / `GroupStore` | Versioned-JSON persistence. |
| `BackendEvent` | Backend→UI push channel: add/remove/update/level/volume-changed/routedApps. |
| `OutputBackend` | The protocol seam between app and audio routing. |
| `MockBackend` | Fully-working offline backend for tests/demos. |
| `OwnToneBackend` | HTTP-polling backend against OwnTone; superseded. |
| `NativeBackend` | Shipping backend; drives `AirPlayEngine`, owns capture gate. |
| `NativeDiscovery` | Bonjour discovery (AP2 + AP1). |
| `NativeCaptureCoordinator` | Whole-system Core Audio capture; excludes individually-routed + user-excluded apps. |
| `PerAppCaptureCoordinator` | Per-process Core Audio capture taps, one per individually-routed app. |
| `AppRouteMixer` | Combines per-app captures into per-destination mixed streams; applies per-app volume. |
| `SystemOutputVolume` | Reads/writes the Mac's output volume/mute. |
| `makeBackend(_:)` | The one factory that knows concrete backend types. |
